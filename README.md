## 📝 Description
A personal portfolio website designed to showcase my projects, technical skills, and career aspirations. It includes a contact form, curated project highlights, and a clean, responsive design, tailored for recruiters, collaborators, and technical hiring teams.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Deployment**: Vercel  
**Email Handling**: Resend API  
**Other Tools**: ShadCN UI  

## ⚙️ Features
- Project cards with brief descriptions
- Resume download and viewer
- Contact form with validation and Resend integration
- Fully responsive layout
- Optional: Dark mode toggle

## 🚀 Development Process

Creating this portfolio website was not just about presenting my work – it was also an opportunity to learn and grow in areas such as UI design, React, Next.js, and AI-assisted development. Below is an overview of the process I followed:

### 🔍 1. Research and Planning

I began by researching what makes an effective developer portfolio. A useful YouTube video by *Steve Builds Websites* highlighted several best practices:

- Keep the interface minimal and easy to navigate  
- Showcase only a curated selection of projects  
- Ensure responsiveness and accessibility

Using these principles as a foundation, I outlined a structure that reflected my goals and technical strengths.

### ⚛️ 2. Selecting the Tech Stack

Initially, I considered using React, as I had previously developed a small bucket list app with it. However, after exploring the tools used by other developers and reading further documentation, I decided to use **Next.js**. This decision was based on its:

- Built-in routing and static site generation  
- Modular and reusable architecture  
- Support for the modern App Router

To reinforce my knowledge, I completed the following official tutorials from the Next.js documentation:
- [React Foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)  
- [App Router Dashboard Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)

These learning resources helped me revisit core concepts and gave me the confidence to move forward with the project.

### 🤖 3. Using AI and v0 for Prototyping

I experimented with **v0 by Vercel**, an AI-powered tool that generates websites based on written prompts. I used it to:

- Generate a basic layout based on a prompt that aligned with the design principles I had researched  
- Explore community-generated UI components and templates  
- Practice prompt refinement to better guide the output

This was a valuable learning experience that combined AI tooling with creative decision-making.

### 💻 4. Development and Customisation

Once I had a suitable starting point, I forked the code, downloaded it, and continued development in **Cursor IDE**. My contributions included:

- Customising components and layouts to reflect my personal style  
- Adding project summaries and my CV  
- Building a working contact form using **Resend** to handle email submissions  
- Ensuring the site was fully responsive with the help of **Tailwind CSS**

### 🚀 5. Deployment

I deployed the final site using **Vercel**, which offered a smooth deployment process and excellent support for Next.js projects.

### 💡 Key Takeaways and Skills Gained

- Strengthened my understanding of **React** and **Next.js (App Router)**  
- Practised building modern, responsive interfaces using **Tailwind CSS**  
- Learned how to use AI tools like **v0** to support rapid prototyping  
- Developed skills in adapting and extending open-source code from the community  
- Gained experience in integrating services such as **Resend** for form handling  
- Completed the full development lifecycle, from design through to deployment

---

This project not only helped me to present my work effectively, but also deepened my skills in designing, building, and delivering modern web solutions. These are the same skills I intend to apply and develop further in a future role as a Solution Architect or Business Analyst.

## 🔭 Future Improvements

- Implement internationalisation (i18n) to support multiple languages  
- Integrate a content management system (such as Notion or Contentful) to simplify content updates  
- Add a blog section using Markdown-based posts for easier writing and formatting  
- Use `react-pdf` to generate a dynamic CV directly from the site
